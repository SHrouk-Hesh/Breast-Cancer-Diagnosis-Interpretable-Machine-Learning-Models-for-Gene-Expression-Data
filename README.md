## Breast Cancer Diagnosis: Interpretable Machine Learning Models for Gene Expression Data


This project explores interpretable machine learning approaches for breast cancer diagnosis using a biomedical dataset of tumor-related features. We build an end-to-end pipeline that includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier detection, feature scaling, and supervised classification to distinguish malignant vs benign cases.

Several baseline and tree-based models are implemented and compared—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—with performance evaluated using accuracy and k-fold cross-validation. The project emphasizes interpretability by analyzing feature correlations and model-driven feature importance to identify the most informative predictors for diagnosis.
